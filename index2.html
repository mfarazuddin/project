               <h1>Our Mission</h1>
               <p>Through Petuk Ji- Business App we intend to help our local sellers and food joint owners to increase their business by providing local seller a platform to go online and additional platform to food joints. Our lower commissions from sellers shall ensure that they would want to have business through us. Our app shall also allow you to create your own promotions and showcase items on the go.

               <h1>BENEFITS <span>THAT WE PROVIDE</span></h1>

               <div class="first">
                    <h1>Lowest Commission Structure</h1>
                    <p>
                         Food items need to be priced higher because food delivery partners charge a significant commission from the total sales. We believe that delivering value-for-money will help fostering long term relationships. Hence our commissions shall be significantly lower than the current market prevailing rates.
